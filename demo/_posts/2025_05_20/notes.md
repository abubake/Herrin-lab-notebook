## ICRA2025 Day 2

- Met Evan Palmer in underwater robotics session (OSU)
    - Met several times with Brian, proffesor at OSU. Works in optimization.
- Talked with several Qualisys representatives
    - Jacob, Steph, Luis, and some others.
- Saw Jordan Peper (Ivan Ruchkin student) world model poster session.
    - Interesting how control can be informed from latent embeddings.
- Saw Antonio and Ruo present their works.
- Ran into Ananya twice from ICUI as well

### People to look into:
- Matthew Kelly - works explaining trajectory optimization clearly


### TO DO:
- AI resume review
- Send resume to Luis from Qualysis

### At Exhibition:
- Find out where 7xr company is located (if present)
- Alt-bionics: San Antonio + Austin
- Applied Research Associates (ARA): Fort Worth Location?
- Amazon robotics: check in person if anything in the area.

### Papers to help with Robotics/BlueROV:
- A Data-driven velocity estimator for autonomous underwater vehicles experiencing unmeasurable flow and wave disturbance (Scott Mayberry)
    - Why is it useful: their velocity estimator could be used to get a better velocity estimate
    - Limitation: 2D, not extended to 3D yet.
    - GIT/ HKUST
- 3D Obstacle Avoidance and Path Planning for Unmanned Underwate Vehicles Using Elastic Bands
    - Herman Amundsen + NTNU + SINTEF
    - SINTEF works with aquaculture robotics in norway, Herman works there.
    - 4DOF UW Vehicle.
    - works in dynamic environments
    - Elastic bands is like Potential field + bands.
- Dynamic end effector trajectory tracking for small-scale UVMS
    - Great controls work, models dynamics of the end effector as well.
    - Natalie Bauschmann (TUM)
    - good example for controls. Want to see their controller for BR2.
    - Daniel Duecker (TU Munich) nice guy, connect on Linkedin
- DeepVL: Dynamics and Inertial Measurements-Based  Deep Velocity Learning for Underwater odometry
    - NUST (norway)
    - using RNN GRU's to get better velcoty and covariance estimates to pass to an EKF for robot state estimation, outperforms baseline.
